  content: "Instructions:  In a shaker filled with ice, combine dark rum, cr\xE8me
    de cassis, and lime juice. Shake gently until well chilled \u2014 not violently,
    like a storm, but soft, like a whisper at midnight.  Strain into a chilled highball
    glass filled with fresh ice.  Slowly pour the tonic water over the back of a
    spoon to create a gentle gradient of color \u2014 it should look like a dusk
    sky melting into starlight.  Float a single barspoon of absinthe over the top.
    Let it sit for a few seconds, then swirl \u2014 just once.  Garnish with a dried
    orange wheel and a piece of star anise. The aroma will bloom gently with each
    sip.  "
